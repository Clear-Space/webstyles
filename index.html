					<h3>Typography <em>Version 1</em></h3>

					<div class="bodyStyles bodyStyles1">
					
						<h2>Sections <a href="#">Linked</a></h2>

						<p>The main page header of this guide is an <code>h1</code> element. Any header elements may include links, as depicted in the example.</p>

						<p>The secondary header above is an <code>h2</code> element, which may be used for any form of important page-level header. More than one may be used per page. Consider using an <code>h2</code> unless you need a header level of less importance, or as a sub-header to an existing <code>h2</code> element.</p>
						
						<h3>Third-Level Header <a href="#">Linked</a></h3>
						
						<p>The header above is an <code>h3</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h2</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
						
						<h4>Fourth-Level Header <a href="#">Linked</a></h4>
						
						<p>The header above is an <code>h4</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h3</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
						
						<h5>Fifth-Level Header <a href="#">Linked</a></h5>
						
						<p>The header above is an <code>h5</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h4</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
						
						<h6>Sixth-Level Header <a href="#">Linked</a></h6>
						
						<p>The header above is an <code>h6</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h5</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
						
						<h2 id="grouping">Grouping content</h2>
						
						<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
						
						<p>All paragraphs are wrapped in <code>p</code> tags. Additionally, <code>p</code> elements can be wrapped with a <code>blockquote</code> element <em>if the <code>p</code> element is indeed a quote</em>. 
						Historically, <code>blockquote</code> has been used purely to force indents, but this is now achieved using CSS. Reserve <code>blockquote</code> for quotes.</p>
						
						<h3>Horizontal rule</h3>
						
						<p>The <code>hr</code> element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book. The following extract from <cite>Pandora&#8217;s Star</cite> by Peter F. Hamilton shows two paragraphs that precede a scene change and the paragraph that follows it:</p>
						
						<div class="example">
							<p>Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwearth could be appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.</p>
							<p><i>Maybe it won&#8217;t be that bad</i>, he told himself. The lie was comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night&#8217;s shift.</p>
							<hr/>
							<p>The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow of Gralmond&#8217;s winters.</p>
						</div><!-- / .example -->

						<h3>Pre-formatted text</h3>
						
						<p>The <code>pre</code> element represents a block of pre-formatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements. Such examples are an e-mail (with paragraphs indicated by blank lines, lists indicated by lines prefixed with a bullet), fragments of computer code (with structure indicated according to the conventions of that language) or displaying <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> art. Here&#8217;s an example showing the printable characters of <abbr>ASCII</abbr>:</p>
						
						<div class="example">
							<pre><samp>&#32; ! " # $ % &amp; ' ( ) * + , - . /
								0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; &lt; = &gt; ?
								@ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O
								P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \ ] ^ _
								` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o
							p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~</samp></pre>
						</div><!-- / .example -->
						
						<h3>Blockquotes</h3>
						
						<p>The <code>blockquote</code> element represents a section that is being quoted from another source.</p>
						
						<div class="example">
							<blockquote cite="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206">
								<p>Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.</p>
							</blockquote>
						</div><!-- / .example -->
						
						<h3>Ordered list</h3>
						
						<p>The <code>ol</code> element denotes an ordered list, and various numbering schemes are available through the CSS (including 1,2,3&#8230; a,b,c&#8230; i,ii,iii&#8230; and so on). Each item requires a surrounding <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag, to denote individual items within the list (as you may have guessed, <code>li</code> stands for list item).</p>
						
						<div class="example">
							<ol>
								<li>This is an ordered list.</li>
								<li>
									This is the second item, which contains a sub list
									<ol>
										<li>This is the sub list, which is also ordered.</li>
										<li>It has two items.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>This is the final item on this list.</li>
							</ol>
						</div><!-- / .example -->
						
						<h3>Unordered list</h3>
						
						<p>The <code>ul</code> element denotes an unordered list (ie. a list of loose items that don&#8217;t require numbering, or a bulleted list). Again, each item requires a surrounding <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag, to denote individual items. Here is an example list showing the constituent parts of the British Isles:</p>
						
						<div class="example">
							<ul>
								<li>
									United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:
									<ul>
										<li>England</li>
										<li>Scotland</li>
										<li>Wales</li>
										<li>Northern Ireland</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Republic of Ireland</li>
								<li>Isle of Man</li>
								<li>
									Channel Islands:
									<ul>
										<li>Bailiwick of Guernsey</li>
										<li>Bailiwick of Jersey</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
