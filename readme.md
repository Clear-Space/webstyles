**Description:** Responsive HTML & CSS template with repeatable patterns for exploring design elements such as colours or typography. 

**Credits**:

1. Original CSS & HTML from Dave Gamache's [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) framework.
2. Paul Robert Lloyd's [Barebones](http://barebones.paulrobertlloyd.com/) template used to test HTML elements.

*****

This simple HTML & CSS template is inspired by Samantha Warren's [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/). Style Tiles open up the conversation about design without designing a a website in Photoshop. 

I loved the *idea* behind Style Tiles: a simple way to share early design ideas with clients. However, when I tried to mock up some design ideas using the Style Tiles template, I was frustrated. 

I'm a web designer and going into Photoshop to change a colour's HEX code felt wrong. And what about typography? If you work on the web, you know that type varies between Photoshop and the browser. (*Even with Typekit Sync!*)

So, I created this template. My **Web Styles** template is nothing fancy but it allows you to create colour palettes using old fashioned HTML & CSS (or SASS), try out type options and more. 

### What You Can Do with Web Styles 

1. Quickly enter hexcodes to experiment with colours for a design
2. Test out different fonts for your project's copy
3. Compare different typefaces and share with your client - in the browser.
4. Easily switch to a different font or colour using the included variables. 
5. Experiment with layouts using the included grid (from [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/))
6. Begin building a style guide *while* you develop your initial design.
